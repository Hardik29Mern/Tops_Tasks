    <h2>The History of HTML</h2>

     <p>HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</p>

   <p> Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether. The latest version is known as HTML5.</p>
    <p>
    A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
    </p>
<p>the concept of hypertext was proposed by comp scientist ted nelson in the 1960s . in the 1980s time berners-lee , a british comp scintist , introduced the world wide web www and developed the first html  </p>
<p>html 2.0 (1995)</p>
<p>html 3.2 (1997)</p>
<p>html 4.0 (1997-99)</p>
<p>html 5 2014 html 5 was a major milestone with a focus on multimedia , improved semantics and better support for web app ex video audio picture img  </p>

     <h2>Syntax of Html</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>This is the starting of HTML page</li>
        <li>The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document</li>
        <li>The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element of an HTML page</li>
        <li>This is a starting tag of HTML <head> </li>
            
    <!-- This is a meta tag <meta> and its not require to closing tag, It has some value to perform it. -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

        <li>The &lt;head&gt; element contains meta information about the HTML page</li>
        <li>The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)&lt;/li&gt;
        <li>The &lt;body&gt; element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</li>
            <li>The &lt;h1&gt; element defines a large heading</li>
            <li>The &lt;p&gt; element defines a paragraph</li>
     </ul>
    <h2>Features of HTML</h2>
    <p>1) It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily understood and modified.</p>
    <p>2) It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML because it has a lot of formatting tags.</p>
    <p>3) It is a markup language, so it provides a flexible way to design web pages along with the text.</p>
    <p>4) It is platform-independent because it can be displayed on any platform like Windows, Linux, and Macintosh, etc.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of HTML</h2>
    <p>It cannot produce dynamic output alone, since it's a static language.</p>
    <p>Errors can be costly.</p>
    <p>If we need to write down long code for creating a webpage then it produces some complexity.</p>

<p><h2>opening tag and content and closing tag  and then mix(combination ) elements </h2></p>
<p>attributes are used along with the html tags to define the characteristics of the element.</p>
<p> attributes provide additional infromations about elements  </p>
<p> ex < html  lang = "en"> </p>
