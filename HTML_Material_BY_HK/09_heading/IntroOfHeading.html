    <p><b>What is Heading tag in HTML?</b></p>

        These 6 heading elements are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6; with h1 being the highest level and h6 being the least.

        <li>&lt;h2&gt; is used for subheadings, if there are further sections under the subheadings then the &lt;h3&gt;
            elements are used.</li>
        <li>&lt;h6&gt; for the small heading (smallest one).</li>
        <li>
            Browsers display the contents of headings in different sizes. The exact size at which each browser shows the
